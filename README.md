# CyberShield: AI-Powered Cyberbullying Detection & Auto-Response System

CyberShield is an advanced system designed to protect users from online harassment and cyberbullying through real-time message monitoring, AI-powered abuse detection, and automated response mechanisms.

## Problem Statement

Women and girls on social media often face online harassment and repeated abusive messages or comments. Manual blocking or reporting is reactive and delayed, leaving victims exposed to psychological harm. There is a need for an automated system that detects, alerts, and mitigates online bullying in real time.

## Solution Overview

CyberShield provides a comprehensive solution that:

- **Monitors messages in real-time** using WebSocket connections
- **Detects abusive content** using Groq AI language model and keyword analysis
- **Implements a threshold mechanism**:
  - 1-2 abusive messages → Alert notification to the user
  - Multiple abusive messages → Automatically block the sender
- **Generates evidence reports** for reporting to authorities
- **Offers customizable sensitivity settings** based on user comfort level

## Key Features

✅ **Real-time Detection** of abusive/harassing messages  
✅ **Threshold-based Alerts & Blocking** of offenders  
✅ **Automated Safe Report Generation** for authorities  
✅ **Admin Dashboard** with system-wide analytics (admin-only access)  
✅ **Real-time WebSocket Chat** with reliable connection management  
✅ **Premium UI Design** with modern Material-UI theming  
✅ **Role-based Access Control** (Admin vs Regular Users)  
✅ **Privacy-first approach** (data stays local or encrypted)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Material-UI

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn
- Groq API key

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CyberShield
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_for_jwt
   ```

5. Create admin user and test users:
   ```
   python create_admin.py
   ```

6. Start the backend server:
   ```
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure API endpoint and WebSocket base URL:
   Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8000
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

### Deploying the Frontend to Vercel

1. Commit the repository so that the root-level `vercel.json` file is available remotely.
2. In the Vercel dashboard (or via `vercel` CLI), create a new project by importing this repository. The configuration file automatically points the build to `frontend/package.json`.
3. Define the required environment variables for both Preview and Production deployments:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` → public HTTPS URL of the FastAPI backend (for local testing you can keep `http://localhost:8000`).
   - `REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_URL` → public WebSocket endpoint of the backend (e.g., `wss://api.example.com`).
4. Make sure the backend service is reachable from the deployed frontend (host it on a platform that supports FastAPI + WebSockets, such as Railway, Render, or a VM).
5. Trigger a deployment. Vercel will run `npm install` and `npm run build` inside the `frontend` folder and serve the generated static assets with correct client-side routing fallbacks.

> **Security note:** The sensitive backend-only values you received (`GROQ_API_KEY`, `HF_TOKEN`, `SECRET_KEY`) must never be committed to the repository. Store them as environment variables on the backend hosting provider (or use `vercel env add` if you later move the backend into Vercel serverless functions).
